# data-analytics-roadmap
Roadmap for learning data analytics 

## Progress Journal

### Day 1 - Tue May 10, 2022: Prepared My MacBook for Data Analytics
- Learned about a Python library called [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
- Got introduced to [Cython](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/)
- For the first time, I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install [Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). In the past, I used a Node installer to install Node.js and npm
- Ran my first [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and discovered how to run [MS SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) on a Mac
- Executed my first SQL Server query in [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Figured out how to properly create [aliases](https://youtu.be/G2GlntF9TKw) in zsh
- Completed my [first check point](https://github.com/users/dannydore/projects/1/views/1) regarding my Data Analytics Roadmap

### Day 2 - Wed May 11, 2022: Began DataCamp Data Scientist with Python Certification
- Started the **Python Basics** section of [**Introduction to Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 3 - Thu May 12, 2022: Continued Working on "Introduction to Python"
- Completed the **Python Basics** and the **Python Lists** sections of [**Introduction to Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 4 - Fri May 13, 2022: Completed "Introduction to Python"
- Completed the **Functions and Packages** and the **NumPy** sections of [**Introduction to Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 5 - Sat May 14, 2022: Started "Intermediate Python"
- Finished the **Matplotlib** section of [**Intermediate Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 6 - Sun May 15, 2022: Continued Working on "Intermediate Python"
- Completed the **Dictionaries & Pandas** section of [**Intermediate Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 7 - Mon May 16, 2022: Finished Two More Sections of "Intermediate Python"
- Finished the **Logic, Control Flow and Filtering** section and the **Loops** section of [**Intermediate Python**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

### Day 8 - Tue May 17, 2022: Started Work Data Analysis Project
- Watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7i6zxHVj2Q) from Alex the Analyst on the differences between MySQL, Postgresql, and Microsoft SQL Server
- Watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfYN51kDHJ4) from Avery Smith on how he broke into the Data Science industry while working as an undergraduate lab technician and learning how to analyze the data he was recording in the lab
- Started working on a project to analyze data regarding audio conferencing platforms

### Day 9 - Wed May 18, 2022: Continued Working on Audio Conferencing Platforms Data Analysis Project
- Preprocessed the data and completed the first question of the project on determining who the users are
- Learned from someone on the [PuPPy](https://www.pspython.com/app/) Slack Channel that JupyterLab is the successor to Jupyter Notebook. Yesterday, I started using JupyterLab to work on that work project
- [Discovered](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49572579/pandas-drop-first-columns-after-csv-read) that while reading data from the csv and creating a pandas dataframe, you could use loc to extract only the columns you want from the csv
- My friend informed me that when you are changing the same dataframe, make sure to use the *inplace* argument, as it avoids you making unnecessary copies of your data

### Day 10 - Thu May 19, 2022: Finished First Part of a Work Data Analysis Project
- Finished the first part of a work data analysis project
- Learned how to use [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US) and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)

### Day 11 - Fri May 20, 2022: Listened to a Podcast Episode on Data Literacy
- Listened to episode 85 of DataFramed: [Building Data Literacy at Starbucks](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1AOAJOQnGKeFLo6luHAlA6?si=4a44e891f9f94665)

### Day 12 - Sat May 21, 2022: Completed "Intermediate Python"
